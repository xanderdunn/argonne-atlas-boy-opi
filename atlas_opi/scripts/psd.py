# Description: This is the PSD script in scripts.opi

# The EPICS extensions version of caget does not support -S string
#   output.  Hence, we use the EPICS base version.  A linux-x86_64
#   binary has been included in the sdds directory

# This script will be executed from the directory containing the css
#   binary.  All paths will be relative to this location.

# Originally this was a shell script, but I changed it to a Python script
#   because it made path finding much easier.  I can tell CSS BOY to
#   execute from $(user.dir), which is where css was executed

# Get the absolute path of the css binary
css_dir_var = System.getProperty("osgi.install.area")
css_dir = css_dir_var.split(":")[1]

# cwd=css_loc
# export PATH=/usr/local/oag/apps/bin/linux-x86:$PATH
# Get the file save duration time as a variable
# This is run from ops/cavCtl/css/CSS_EPICS/

# If this PV is given a relative path, then the IOC treats it relative to the 
#    location where the IOC was started.  I can't get this info, so I can't
#    handle relative paths.  Despite the below code, only absolute paths work
filepath = p.communicate()[0] # Get the output of the above command
# If the user defined an absolute path, then it will be unchanged.
# If the user defined a relative path, it will be made absolute relative to
#    spxrfshare
